Let's start with a brief history of the C programming language.

## The History of C
The C programming language was invented in the Bell Labs in 1969 as a by product of the UNIX operating system. 
It was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson as an easier way to code on the UNIX platform.

## C Fundamentals
### Writing a simple program
```c
/*	Program letus.c	*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("Let us C!/n");
	
	return 0;
}
```
**Filename:** *letus.c*

Every C program follow a general form
```c
directives

int main(void)
{
	statements;
}
```
#### What are directives?
Before a C program is compiled, it is first edited by a program called a preprocessor. Commands intended for the preprocessor are called directives.
